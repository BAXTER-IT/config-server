			<p>In order to speed up introducing the Baxter Configuration Server
				in production, it has been decided to implement the application in
				few phases. Each phase will extend its superior with additional
				features.
			</p>

			<subsection name="Phase 1">
				<p>This phase is targeted to Baxter Price Engine.
				</p>
				<p>The goal of first phase is to build the centralized configuration
					storage for Price Engine components and re-factor those components
					to use this storage.
					No management UI is expected. No support for
					configuration revisions.
					It should be the simplest solution that
					allows to avoid the
					redundancy of configuration sources among the
					same environment.
					Operating personal will manage configuration by
					means of manual
					editing of files.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Phase 2">
				<p>This phase is targeted to Baxter Price Engine.
				</p>
				<p>The goal of this phase is to develop a graphical UI to manage the
					configuration.
					There should be possibility to manage configuration revisions.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Phase 3">
				<p>This phase extends support of other Baxter products.
				</p>
				<p>This phase adds support for other products, like ABOS, CD etc. It
					includes integration of those products with Baxter Configuration.
				</p>
